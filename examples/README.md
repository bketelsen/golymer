# golymer examples

To view the examples running you can install `gopherjs` with:

```
go get -u github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs
```

And then run `$ gopherjs serve`, it will then serve on `localhost:8080` and dynamically compile go packages.

Now you can go to [localhost:8080/github.com/microo8/golymer/examples](http://localhost:8080/github.com/microo8/golymer/examples) and explore the examples directories.
